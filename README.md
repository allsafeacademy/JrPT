# JrPT-Notes
This Junior Penetration Testing Training course is designed to provide a comprehensive foundation in the field of penetration testing. 
Students will learn the fundamental concepts, techniques, and tools used by penetration testers to identify and exploit vulnerabilities in computer 
systems, networks, and applications. Through a combination of theoretical knowledge and hands-on practical exercises, students will develop the skills
required to assess the security of an organization's digital assets and provide recommendations for improving their overall security posture.

Course Duration: 8 weeks (32 hours)
